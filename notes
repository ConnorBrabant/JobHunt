MAKE SURE TO USE PYTHON3 TO GET MOST UP TO DATE VERSION

to start a new django project -> django-admin startproject
to make individual apps in the project -> python3 manage.py startapp appname in the root directory
- apps function as individual parts of the site (store, blogs, etc)

to run server -> python3 manage.py runserver
